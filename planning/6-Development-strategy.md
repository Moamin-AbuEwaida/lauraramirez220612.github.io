# UX/UI Design
You've come full circle, time to rebuild that home page you started in the Precourse. Over the next two weeks you will be rebuilding your home page at username.github.io to showcase everything you've learned so far.

There will be 3 parts to the 2-week project in UX/UI Design:

°  Designing: Practice User Interviews and Design Thinking by working in pairs to come up with your Home Page backlogs, wireframes and READMEs.

    You will each create a repository and fork each other's repositories. (do not add each other as collaborators!)
    Push your interview notes to the /planning folder in your fork of their Home Page and send them a PR
    Help each other turn the interview notes into a Backlog and a complete Wireframe. then you're on your own!
    
°  Developing: Practice solo development by turning your backlog into your new Home Page. Learn about open source libraries by choosing and using a CSS Framework in your project.

    Complete your Development Strategy
    Set up your Project Board & Issues
    Develop!
    Retrospect
    
°  Contributing: Practice contributing to Open Source projects. A contribution can be as simple as fixing a spelling mistake, adding a translation, or participating in an issue's discussion. It's best to make small contributions you are sure will be helpful:

    Contribute to your classmates' Home Pages. They will not give you access to their repo, so you will need to use 
    a Fork and comment in issues/PRs as an outside collaborator. 
    Make a contribution to your CSS Framework's repository. This doesn't need to be anything fancy, whatever you are 
    comfortable with!
    You home page is a never-ending project. You can continuously improve it as you learn more, and we will rebuild 
    it again at HYF after you learn about  
    JavaScript APIs. The goal in these two weeks is only to make a solid start, not make everything perfect.
